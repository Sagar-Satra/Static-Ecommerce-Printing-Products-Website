# Static E-commerce Website
Assignment 1
Hi, my name is Sagar Satra and I have created a simple E-commerce website for shopping Customized Print Products.
Earlier I was in the printing business and liked the idea of creating a website where users can create their own print products as per their personalized design.

I have created two pages 
1. Printing Hub (For personalized stationery and other products)
2. Gift Hub (Gifting customized print products to others).

I have used the following tags:
1. head - standard tag
2. body - standard tag
3. href - for linking images, videos, relative and absolute links.
4. rel - for linking CSS file
5. header - introductory tag
6. main - for main body content
7. footer - for closing information
8. nav - for navigating to links and sections of the website
9. class - for assigning properties to various elements/groups
10. id - unique IDs are given for unique elements.
11. a - Anchor tag for creating hyperlinks
12. detail - for displaying additional data on products in the website
13. Summary - for displaying a summary of the whole data.
14. br - for putting line breaks in the website
15. hr - creating a horizontal line for better visuals.
16. h1, h2,h3 - heading tags
17. favicon - to display an icon in the title of a webpage
18. Table - for putting size/data information of the products
